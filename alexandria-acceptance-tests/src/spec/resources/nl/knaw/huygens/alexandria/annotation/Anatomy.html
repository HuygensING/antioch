<title>Alexandria: Anatomy of a resource</title>

<body data-desc="Anatomy of an annotation">

<div id="resource-anatomy" data-desc="What does an annotation look like?" c:execute="clearStorage()">
    When we <code>GET</code> an annotation, what does it look like and what is the meaning of the properties?
    Let us assume that:
    <ul>
        <li c:execute="resourceExists(#resId)">
            a (parent) resource exists with uuid: <code c:set="#resId">c3533708-61c5-11e5-9a91-87af0920e91d</code>
        </li>
        <li c:execute="#annoId = hasAnnotation(#resId)">
            this resource has an annotation: <code c:echo="#annoId"></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h:request>When we
        <h:get>/annotations/$annoId</h:get>
        we receive
        <h:status>200 OK</h:status>
        and body
