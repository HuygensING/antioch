<title>Alexandria: Anatomy of a resource</title>

<body data-desc="Anatomy of a resource">

<div id="resource-anatomy" data-desc="What does a resource look like?" c:execute="clearStorage()">
    When we <code>GET</code> a resource, what does it look like and what is the meaning of the properties?
    Let us assume that:
    <ul>
        <li c:execute="resourceExists(#resId)">
            a (parent) resource exists with uuid: <code c:set="#resId">69f182ac-5c5f-11e5-8745-ef1581a11364</code>
        </li>
        <li c:execute="#annoId = hasAnnotation(#resId)">
            this resource has an annotation: <code c:echo="#annoId"></code>
        </li>
        <li c:execute="#subId = hasSubresource(#resId)">
            this resource has a subresource: <code c:echo="#subId"></code>
        </li>
        <li c:execute="#subAnnoId = hasAnnotation(#subId)">
            this subresource has an annotation: <code c:echo="#subAnnoId"></code>

        Subresources do not have a <code>ref</code> field, as they do not refer to an external location.
